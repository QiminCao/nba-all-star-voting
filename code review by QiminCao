The style is handsome which is a perfect match for the NBA style.
The features are pretty focused. It can be extended and embeded into a complete app. This is great.
The code is well documented and organized in the appropriate folder.
Implemented 6 components of React and much CRUD of MongoDB.
I have some small suggestions for the web: You might need to change your favicon for your own instead of a React favicon :). I think the voting should do some valid check since the codes now allow negative number. I guess a player cannot have minus-number voting. LOL

In all, it is gorgeous. üëç Good start for MERN app.
